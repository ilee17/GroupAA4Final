### Project Idea and Project Significance

For the final project, our project idea is to display restaurant reviews and rating in the U District area through mapping interface. We are going to be creating our own dataset using a Yelp API Crawler, which we used in a previous class, GEOG 450: Visualizing Seattle. From this dataset, we are given the lastest 3 reviews of 100 resturants in the U District area, which we are going to cut down to the most recent review. Many people, such as tourist, new residence, or even people just wanting to try out a new place, often rely on online reviews to make dining decisions. We want to create a platform that could become a go-to resource for those looking to explore U District's culinary scene. Reviews are helpful tools that serve the purpose of displaying helpful information.We are intending to focus on restaurant compliments in U District and visualizing it using a smartdash board application. It marries the utility of geographic information systems (GIS) with the vast domain of user-generated content on restaurant experiences. Collecting and analyzing data on user preferences and restaurant performance can offer valuable insights for city planners, marketers, and business owners about dining trends and customer demands in U District. 


### Project Functions and Broader Impacts

The interactive functions will be hovering features, legends, and clicking. The users will be able to zoom in and out to see the different restaurats based on color corrdinated proportional symbols. You will be able to click on a symbol in order to find out the restaurant name, the overall rating, and a review taken from yelp. On the side bar, you will be able to click on a bar and it will filter out the restaurants to those who fall within that range.



### Major Data Sources and Targeted Audience

The potential data that will be collected will come from the [King County](https://data.kingcounty.gov/Health-Wellness/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Data/f29f-zza5/about_data) site as well as restaurant business rankings from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michau96/restaurant-business-rankings-2020). [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-seattle-restaurants.html) will also prove to be helpful in mapping the different available restaurants. The reasonable functions that can be completed by the end of the quarter should be all of them given that our team works in a timely and efficient manner. The target audience for this visualization will be for potential restaurant customers, or food critics. In addition, this project is also open to anyone who is curious or interested in smartdash boards. 




### Project Format

The project focus to create a "Smart Dashboard" format to highlight the user inferface. This approach will allow us to present a dynamic and interactive experience for users, leveraging both geographic and user-generated data to inform dining decisions. We will utilize a Web Mercator projection which is standard for most web mapping applications due to its compatibility with the global scale and online platforms. Set initial zoom levels to focus on Seattle, providing a city-wide view while allowing users to zoom in for street-level details.

Interactive Functions: Include filters for specific words  types of comments such as food quality: "Customers complain about tasteless, undercooked, or service: "Issues include rude, slow, or inattentive service from staff."


Interactive functions might also allow users to save favorite restaurants, view detailed reviews, and get directions. we will the 

#### GUI Arrangement:

The main map occupies the central part of the dashboard.
Filters and search options are accessible from a sidebar or a top bar.
Detailed restaurant information appears in a sidebar on click or hover over map symbols.
An optional "Recommendations" or "Trending" section could highlight popular spots.
