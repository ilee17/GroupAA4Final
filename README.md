### Project Idea and Project Significance

For the final project, our project idea is to display restaurant reviews and rating in Seattle, Washington through mapping interface. We plan on using data from King County database about restaurant inspections. From this data set, we cut down the data to around 35 places in order to complete this project in a timely manner. Tourists and new residents often rely on online reviews to make dining decisions. We want to create a platform that could become a go-to resource for those looking to explore Seattle's culinary scene. Reviews are helpful tools that serve the purpose of displaying helpful information.We are intending to focus on restaurant compliments in Seattle and visualizing it using a smartdash board application. It marries the utility of geographic information systems (GIS) with the vast domain of user-generated content on restaurant experiences. Collecting and analyzing data on user preferences and restaurant performance can offer valuable insights for city planners, marketers, and business owners about dining trends and customer demands in Seattle. 


### Project Functions and Broader Impacts

Proposed interactive functions will be hovering features, legends, interactive and updating subfields. The users will be able to zoom in and out to see the comments tread in a specific area or check on a specific restaurant. As we introduce our main functions, The setbacks that could be generated by this pproject is that popular or well-known restaurants might get more attention, overshadowing smaller, possibly equally deserving establishments. There's also the risk of biased reviews affecting a restaurant's reputation unfairly. We will be seeking ways to review and filter out biased or discriminatory comments and  develop algorithms that give fair visibility to all restaurants. 




### Major Data Sources and Targeted Audience

The potential data that will be collected will come from the [King County](https://data.kingcounty.gov/Health-Wellness/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Data/f29f-zza5/about_data) site as well as restaurant business rankings from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michau96/restaurant-business-rankings-2020). [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-seattle-restaurants.html) will also prove to be helpful in mapping the different available restaurants. The reasonable functions that can be completed by the end of the quarter should be all of them given that our team works in a timely and efficient manner. The target audience for this visualization will be for potential restaurant customers, or food critics. In addition, this project is also open to anyone who is curious or interested in smartdash boards. 




### Project Format

The project focus to create a "Smart Dashboard" format to highlight the user inferface. This approach will allow us to present a dynamic and interactive experience for users, leveraging both geographic and user-generated data to inform dining decisions. We will utilize a Web Mercator projection which is standard for most web mapping applications due to its compatibility with the global scale and online platforms. Set initial zoom levels to focus on Seattle, providing a city-wide view while allowing users to zoom in for street-level details.

Interactive Functions: Include filters for specific words  types of comments such as food quality: "Customers complain about tasteless, undercooked, or service: "Issues include rude, slow, or inattentive service from staff."


Interactive functions might also allow users to save favorite restaurants, view detailed reviews, and get directions. we will the 

#### GUI Arrangement:

The main map occupies the central part of the dashboard.
Filters and search options are accessible from a sidebar or a top bar.
Detailed restaurant information appears in a sidebar on click or hover over map symbols.
An optional "Recommendations" or "Trending" section could highlight popular spots.
