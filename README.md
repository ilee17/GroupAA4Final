### Project Idea and Project goals

For the final project, our project idea is to display restaurant reviews and rating in the U District area through mapping interface. We are going to be creating our own dataset using a Yelp API Crawler, which we used in a previous class, GEOG 450: Visualizing Seattle. From this dataset, we are given the lastest 3 reviews of 100 resturants in the U District area, which we are going to cut down to the most recent review. Many people, such as tourist, new residence, or even people just wanting to try out a new place, often rely on online reviews to make dining decisions. We want to create a platform that could become a go-to resource for those looking to explore U District's culinary scene. Reviews are helpful tools that serve the purpose of displaying helpful information.We are intending to focus on restaurant compliments in U District and visualizing it using a smartdash board application. It marries the utility of geographic information systems (GIS) with the vast domain of user-generated content on restaurant experiences. Collecting and analyzing data on user preferences and restaurant performance can offer valuable insights for city planners, marketers, and business owners about dining trends and customer demands in U District.Â 


### Project Functions and Broader Impacts

The interactive functions will be hovering features, legends, and clicking. The users will be able to zoom in and out to see the different restaurats based on color corrdinated proportional symbols. You will be able to click on a symbol in order to find out the restaurant name, the overall rating, and a review taken from yelp. On the side bar, you will be able to click on a bar and it will filter out the restaurants to those who fall within that range.

### Major Data Sources and Targeted Audience

Our data comes from [yelp](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=restaurants&find_loc=University+District%2C+Seattle%2C+WA) which we obtained using a yelp API crawler. Our target audience would be tourists, new residence, and people just looking to try out a new restaurant. We got our idea for this project from the [NYC reviews](https://blog.mapbox.com/exploring-nyc-open-data-with-3d-hexbins-5af2b7d8bc46) and from Professor Zhao's [earthquakes in Japan](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog458/weeks/week06/index.html )

### Libraries and Web Services

For our project we used mapbox to create our basemap, and github to display our final product. We also used mapbox, D3, and C3 libraries in order to get our smart dashboard to function properly.

### Acknowledgment

We would like to acknowledge professor Zhao and our TA Liz Peng for preparing us with the materials we needed throughout the course in order to create our smart dashboard. We really enjoyed this class as we got to strengthen our GIS skills.
